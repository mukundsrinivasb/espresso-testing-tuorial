Android testing samples
===================================


A collection of samples demonstrating different frameworks and techniques for automated testing.

Prerequisites
--------------

- Android SDK v23
- Android Build Tools v23
- Android Support Repository rev17

Getting Started
---------------

These samples use the Gradle build system. To build a project, enter the project directory and use the `./gradlew assemble` command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

- Use `./gradlew connectedAndroidTest` to run the tests on a connected emulator or device.
- Use `./gradlew test` to run the unit test on your local host.

There is a top-level `build.gradle` file if you want to build and test all samples from the root directory. This is mostly helpful to build on a CI (Continuous Integration) server.
